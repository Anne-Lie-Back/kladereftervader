### Kläder Efter Väder. 

This is a weather web app built with React ´Create React App´ focused on the city of Gothenburg. The app has three major parts, one is the current weather in the city, the next is a forecast for this week, and the third part is a figure showing you what clothes to wear if it’s raining, cold or warm for the younger users of the app. We also included a mobile/desktop view. When you use the app on a larger screen you will see all pages next to one another. On mobile you can use the navbar links on the bottom of the screen to change view or simply type in AppUrl/prognos or AppUrl/kläder in the browser address bar.
